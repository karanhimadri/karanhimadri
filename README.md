# 👋 Hi, I'm Himadri Karan

I'm a Computer Science undergrad and passionate **Full-Stack & Backend Developer** with hands-on experience in both **Java/Spring Boot** and the **MERN stack**. I love building secure, scalable applications — whether it's a robust backend API, a real-time collaborative tool, or an AI-integrated chatbot.

🚀 I'm currently focused on developing production-ready systems, exploring cloud-native deployments, and sharpening my DevOps skills.
