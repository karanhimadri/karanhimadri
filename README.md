## 💼 About Me
I’m a final-year Computer Science student focused on **Java backend development** with hands-on experience in building RESTful services using **Spring Boot**, **JWT-based security**, and relational databases.

Alongside backend development, I have experience in **QA Automation** using Selenium and REST Assured, which helps me write **reliable, testable, and quality-focused software**.

I’m actively preparing for **entry-level Software Engineer / Java Backend roles** in service-based organizations.
